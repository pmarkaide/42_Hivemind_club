# The Hivemind Club
[Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) coding school is based on peer-to-peer learning instead of traditional lesson-based pedagogy. Each student is encouraged to solve the projects through self-learning and discussion among students, but many good ideas and best practices are not shared among all the students due to time/social dynamic constraints.

The Hivemind Club's goal is to serve as a public forum to share the collective knowledge of Hive students and with that expand the range of tools known to solve programming problems.

As projects get more complex, students develop many different ways to solve the same problems. With the Implementation Camp series, we will select remarkable implementations and compare their solutions.
